= Widget Object =

Every instance of a widget is provided a javascript object for which to control it. It is called "widget".

== Properties ==

=== identifier ===
 
{{{ widget.identifier }}}

This is the identifier of the widget. This identifier is the same as the CFBundleIdentifier in the Info.plist file. Or the {{{<widget id="identifier">}}} in the Kludget.xml file.

=== instance ===

{{{ widget.instance }}}

This instance identifier uniquely identifies each widget instance.

=== ondragstart ===

{{{ widget.ondragstart }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget begins to be dragged.

{{{

widget.ondragstart = function()
{
}

}}}

=== ondragend ===

{{{ widget.ondragend }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget is dropped or stops being dragged.

=== onhide ===

{{{ widget.onhide }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget is hidden from the desktop or no longer visible. Put your widget in sleep mode to conserve resources.

=== onremove ===

{{{ widget.onremove }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget is closed or removed.

The Kludget engine will remove all preference settings for the removed widget instance. You may still save some persistent information in the [http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#databases database storage] which is shared by all widget instances and won't be deleted until the package is uninstalled.

=== onsettingschanged ===

{{{ widget.onsettingschanged }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a user changes the widget instance settings or the kludget engine preferences.

=== onshow ===

{{{ widget.onshow }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget becomes visible.

=== onurlreceived ===

{{{ widget.onurlreceived }}}

This contains the event handler to be called when a widget receives a url through a drag-and-drop action.

{{{

widget.onurlreceived = function(url)
{
}

}}}
